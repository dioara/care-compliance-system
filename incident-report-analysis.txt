Current Incident Report PDF Analysis
=====================================

Issues Identified:
1. Report is mostly a summary table view - not detailed individual incident reports
2. Only shows: Reference, Date, Type, Location, Severity, Status, Affected Person, Description
3. Pages 2-4 are almost entirely blank
4. Missing detailed information for each incident:
   - Full incident narrative/description
   - Time of incident
   - Witnesses
   - Immediate actions taken
   - Root cause analysis
   - Corrective actions
   - Follow-up required
   - Manager/supervisor sign-off
   - Investigation details
   - Supporting documentation references

Required Improvements:
- Create a detailed single-incident report format (not summary table)
- Include all incident fields in a narrative/form format
- Make it printable and professional
- Include sections for: Incident Details, Affected Person, Witnesses, Actions Taken, Investigation, Follow-up
