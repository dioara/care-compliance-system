PDF Signature Section Issue Analysis:

Page 2 shows:
- "AUTHORISATION & SIGNATURES" section header
- "Manager/Supervisor:" label appears to have a strikethrough or is cut off
- The signature image appears below it
- "Admin User (User)" and "Signed: 16 December 2025" show correctly
- "Pending signatures:" with bullet points for Reviewer and Witness

Issue: The "Manager/Supervisor:" label text appears to have formatting issues - looks like it has a strikethrough or is being cut off/overlapped by something.

Fix needed: Check the signature type label rendering in the PDF service.
