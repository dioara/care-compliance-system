PDF Spacing Issues Identified:

1. "Date of Incident: 13 December 2025" and "Time of Incident: 17:22" are on the same line - the date wraps and runs into Time
2. "Date Reported: 15 December 2025" and "Closed By: Not specified" are on the same line
3. "Last Updated: 15 December 2025" wraps incorrectly

The issue is that the text fields are not getting proper line breaks between them.
Need to add more vertical spacing (y += value) after each field.
