Action Log PDF Issues Found:

1. Page 1: Main content is fine but the table columns are cut off on the right side
   - "Completed" column is partially visible
   - Table is too wide for the page

2. Pages 2-4: Almost entirely blank pages with only header/footer text
   - Page 2: Only shows "UK Health Kits LTD - Action Log Report" at top
   - Page 3: Only shows "Confidential - For Internal Use Only" in middle
   - Page 4: Only shows "Page 1 of 1" at top right

Issues to fix:
- Table is too wide - need to reduce columns or use smaller font
- Header/footer elements are creating extra blank pages
- Need to use page-break-inside: avoid on content sections
- Footer should only appear at bottom of actual content pages
